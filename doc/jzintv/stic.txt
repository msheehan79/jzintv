Timing for CPU Controlled mode:

 -- SR1 signals start of vertical retrace, and occurs every 16.6ms.  It's
    tied to the CPU's interrupt request line.

 -- There is a ~4ms window after the falling edge of SR1 during which
    the CPU can access STIC registers, GRAM and GROM.  If the program
    desires display, it must write to $0020 during this window.

 -- 4.1ms after the falling edge of SR1, the STIC issues a BUSRQ to the
    CPU so that it may begin fetching cards from System RAM.  The CPU must
    respond with a BUSAK fairly quickly (I'm guessing within ~20 cycles).
    The first BUSRQ/BUSAK period lasts 0.05 ms and is followed by 15
    additional BUSRQ/BUSAK cycles that are issued at 1ms intervals,
    with each lasting 0.11ms apiece.  The time from the initial BUSRQ
    cycle to the 13 that follow it depend on the setting of the vertical
    delay register.
