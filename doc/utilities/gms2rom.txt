  GMS2ROM  -- Convert INTVPC Game Save state to an Intellicart .ROM image
==============================================================================

This utility takes an INTVPC .GMS Game Save state file and attempts to
convert it to a .ROM file.  

It performs this feat by scanning the .GMS file and recovering the state
of the Inty.  It then inserts a small shim into the address space.  This
shim is responsible for loading these state information into the Inty
and then resuming the game.

Usage:

    gms2rom foo.gms [bar.rom]

If you omit the output filename, gms2rom will generate a new file name
which is the same as the Game Save file, except the .gms is replaced with
.ROM.  To get BIN+CFG format output, run the resulting ROM through rom2bin.
