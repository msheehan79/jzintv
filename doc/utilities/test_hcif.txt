  TEST_HCIF  -- Test the INTV2PC Hand Controller Interface
==============================================================================

This utility polls an INTV2PC Hand Controller Interface, showing its
current status onscreen.  This is useful for verifying that the HCIF
is working correctly.

Usage:

    test_hcif [port# [rate]]

where "port#" is 1, 2, or 3 (for LPT1:, LPT2: or LPT3:), and "rate" is
a number from 1 to 100 which indicates the query rate in Hz.

Note:  test_hcif requires root privileges to run under Linux.


TEST_HCIF is not normally built by default and is not part of the binary
distribution.  To build it, from the jzIntv source directory type:

Linux:
    make -f Makefile.linux ../bin/test_hcif

Win32:
    make -f Makefile.w32 ../bin/test_hcif.exe
