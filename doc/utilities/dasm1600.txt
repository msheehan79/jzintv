 Quickstart on DASM1600
==============================================================================

Usage:  dasm1600  objectfile [symfile]
        dasm1600o objectfile [symfile]

        objectfile   -- ROM image that you're interested in disassembling
        symfile      -- Command file which controls dasm1600. 


The 'objectfile' is just a generic, flat CP-1600 ROM image, such as
what as1600 produces.  The ROM image is expected in Big Endian format
by default.  Currently, DASM1600 can handle ROM images with either no
holes, or exactly one hole in them.  This means that cartridge images
larger than 8K can be handled directly, but images larger than 12K
(eg. with ROM at $5000, $D000, and $F000) cannot.

The optional 'symfile' contains commands which inform dasm1600 about
the ROM image you're inspecting.  It accepts the following commands:

     revbytes           -- Says that the ROM image is in little endian.

     org XXXX           -- Sets the origin for the ROM image to XXXX

     data XXXX [YYYY]   -- Says that location XXXX is data.  If two
                           numbers are given, then locations XXXX-YYYY
                           are marked as being data.

     dbdata XXXX [YYYY] -- Like 'data', only it says that the data is
                           in "Double Byte Data" format.

     skip XXXX YYYY     -- Defines a hole in the ROM image where the
                           ROM does NOT exist.  


DASM1600's output is (usually) suitable for reassembly, which is also
convenient.

 Miscellaneous
==============================================================================

Also included in this package is "DASM1600o", which is an older version
of DASM1600 from Frank P.  It does not support the "skip" or "dbdata"
directives in the symfile, and its output is not suitable for direct
reassembly.  It's included for completeness.
