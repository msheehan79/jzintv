  FROMHEX  -- Binary File Generation Utility
==============================================================================

This utility takes a textual hexdump (such as what 'tohex' produces)
and generates a binary file as its output.  This can be useful for
editing binary files with an ordinary text editor.  Also, it can be
useful for creating new binary files from scratch using a human-readable
source format.

Usage:

    fromhex [input [output]]

Where 'input' is the input filename, and 'output' is the output filename.
If the input filename is not specified, or is given as '-', then the
input is taken from stdin.  If the output filename is not specified,
or is given as '-', then the output will go to stdout.

The input format is quite simple.  Fromhex expects 1 or 2 digit
hexadecimal numbers separated by one or more characters of whitespace.
Case does not matter--that is, "1a" and "1A" are both equally valid
hexadecimal numbers.  All text to the right of a '#' is ignored.
This can be useful for writing comments, or whatever.

The astute reader will notice that the above rules allow 'fromhex'
to take the output from 'tohex' seamlessly.  This is purposeful.
Fromhex does not require rigid adherence to the 'tohex' output format
though.

Example:

  ## FONT FILE
  01 02 04 08 10 20 40 80       # slash character
  00 66 FF FF 7E 3C 18 00       # heart character

The above will generate a 16-byte file.
