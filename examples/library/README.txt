This directory contains a variety of functions and definitions that could
be considered "library" functions.  Several of the examples include these
files directly to access various functions, such as the random number
generator, the string-printing routines, and so on.

You are encouraged to use these routines in your programs, either by
INCLUDEing the file or copying the routine inline.  These routines
have been released into the public domain by their author, Joseph
Zbiciak.  You're welcome to use these for whatever purpose you like.

The documentation for each function is contained within the source file
itself.  Please consult the individual files for details.

You may find it convenient to "INCLUDE" these files in your program,
rather than copying the source-code inline.  To do this, simply add
a line in your program such as the following:  (Note the use of 
forward-slashes for path separators.  This works identically under 
both Unix and DOS/Windows.)

    INCLUDE "/full/path/to/library/function.asm"

OR

    INCLUDE "../relative/path/to/library/function.asm"

Alternately, rather than hardcoding the path to the library in
the source code, you can use AS1600's Include Path facility to
specify places to search for INCLUDE files.  The Include Path
can be specified two ways:

 -- On the command line, with "-i /path/to/directory."  You may
    have as many -i arguments as you can fit on the commandline.

 -- With the AS1600_PATH environment variable.  You can specify
    multiple directories to search in the one variable.  The
    names for the individual directories are separated by ';'
    characters (semicolons).
    
The assembler will always search for include files in the following
order:

 1. The current directory.

 2. Any directories specified on the commandline, in the order 
    they were specified.

 3. Any directories specified in the AS1600_PATH listing.
