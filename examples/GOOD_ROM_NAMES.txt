This is a message intended for whoever maintains the "Good ROM" list
from the author of SDK-1600, Joseph Zbiciak.

Below are the names I'd prefer to see for the ROM images contained
in this archive.  And yes, I do want "SDK-1600" in each name, so that
it's clear that it's the version included in SDK-1600, and so that all
the files appear together in an alphabetical listing (kinda like
Song Player).

Also, if you see any of my other programs out there (4-Tris, Song Player,
Bouncing Pixels, etc.), please change the "(PD)" designation to either
"(JZ)" or "(GPL)".  Those ROM images are NOT in the public domain.  I
retain the copyright to them, and I'd like all of my Intellivision ROMs 
distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.  The only
ROM I have produced that *is* in the Public Domain is "Geese".

All of the programs contained in this archive are licensed under the
GNU General Public License as well.  You're welcome to distribute these as 
much as you like.  All I ask is that you abide by the GPL.
