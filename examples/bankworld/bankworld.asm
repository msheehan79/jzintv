;; This demonstration combines the concepts of bankswitching with the       ;;
;; spinning-world demo.  The frames of the spinning world are stored in     ;;
;; the lower part of the Intellicart's address space and are accessed       ;;
;; via a small bankswitched window.                                         ;;
;;                                                                          ;;
;; You may wish to compare this demo to the "world" example as well.        ;;
;; The two are nearly identical, except that this one reads the picture     ;;
;; data via bankswitched window.  This one also is set to build as a 16-bit ;;
;; ROM image (I was feeling lazy).                                          ;;
