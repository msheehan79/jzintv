Release Notes
-------------

jzIntv 1.0:  This is the first jzIntv with a proper version number.  Many
things have been added or changed since the last snapshot release.  There
are too many to list here.

Look around the documentation.  It actually exists now.  It's still somewhat
thin, but it's infinitely more than there was before.  And most of all,
enjoy!    


Platform specific notes
-----------------------

The generic jzIntv documentation lives mostly under doc/jzintv/.  Platform
specific documentation lives under doc/platform/.

Please note that jzIntv is a Linux / UNIX program first, and has been ported 
to Windows and MacOS X.  As a result, using it under these platforms is 
somewhat different than using other software that natively targets these 
platforms.

Arnauld Chevallier and John Tanner have put in work on Windows and MacOS X
GUIs that wrap jzIntv.  These wrappers provide a much more native feel to
jzIntv.  An eventual goal of the jzIntv project is to provide up-to-date
wrappers with each major release of jzIntv, so that every platform can use
jzIntv in the manner that platform prefers.  The raw version I currently
distribute does not contain these niceties.
